Hello,

One of the shortcomings of the most popular chat applications that we use today is that there is no scope to organize your chats whatsoever. 
It is often very frustrating to scroll through one unending list of all your chats, including everything from family groups to hobbies and friends, all mashed up together in a remix 
dictated by an algorithm that is too simplistic to say the least. 

Hence we vowed to create a chat application that not only provides essential communication features but also prioritizes a clean and organized user interface at allows you to organize your
chats into different profiles and folders. A well-organized chat app can streamline user interactions and improve user satisfaction, thereby contributing to its widespread adoption. 
Using the organizational features, we provide in this application are unique and can boost an individual’s productivity and overall output by streamlining their thought process based on their relative environment.

1. You can have different profiles for different workspaces to segregate work and home related chats.​
2. Within a profile, a user can add sub folders and group similar chats within a sub folder to make the chats even more clean and clutter free. ​

You can clone the repo and run this java file to run an instance of the application - src/main/java/user/welcome/WelcomeToChatBookUI.java
This is just a prototype, and we plan to develop this further in the future
